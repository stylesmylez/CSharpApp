Added property as GoogleObject.Directions.HideMarkers. This property controls direction markers visibility (e.g. pushpins with A, B, C etc). It will allow user to draw a route between multiple addresses without having to display each pushpin. See example MapWithDirections.aspx.
Added property as GoogleObject.Directions.PolylineColor. This property controls color of direction line. See example MapWithDirections.aspx.
Added property as GoogleObject.Directions.PolylineWidth. This property controls width of direction line. See example MapWithDirections.aspx.
